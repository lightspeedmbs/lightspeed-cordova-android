<center><b>Lightspeed push Cordova Plugin.</b><br><br></center>

 Below describes the steps you need to do for register Lightspeed Push channels.
 <br><br>
    1. With the action string ActionSet.INITIALIZE_PUSH, initialize a push instance.
    <br><br>
    2. If you're using built-in Lightspeed push, a Lightspeed server status monitor is necessary.
    <br> 
       With action string ActionSet.STATUS_MONITOR you could implement a callback function to monitor the status.
    <br><br> 
    3. Register corresponding channels with action string ActionSet.REGISTER
    <br><br>
    4. Implement a callback function as receiving push with action string ActionSet.RECV_PUSH
    <br><br>
    5. ( Optional ) You could implement other feature of Push with the rest action string. For example, ActionSet.SET_MUTE set the device receiving push without system alarm.
    <br><br>
  For more detail information, please refer to the ActionSet to see what you can do with this plug-in.</body>
